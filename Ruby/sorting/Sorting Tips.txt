Sorting Tips

- Industry standard is merge sort or quick sort
	--> merge sort is both best case and worst case O(n log n)
	--> quick sort is average O(n log n) ... worst case O(n^2)

- In an interview, you ask "can i use the built-in sort method?"
	-- Or write your own (learn some merge sort or quick sort O(n log n))
