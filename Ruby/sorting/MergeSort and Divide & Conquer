MergeSort and Divide & Conquer

- Divide and Conquer refers to an algorithm where you can divide an algorithm to subproblems
- Then you "conquer" each subproblem. If it's small enough to be a base case, you return that value for the subproblem
- Then you "Combine" the conquered subproblems to get to your original solution

Problem
--> broken into 2 subproblems
--> Conquer subproblems --> (1,2)
--> Combine them to reach your solution (3)
